Cloud Canary
============

A lightweight Python daemon that alerts you if your host has been up for longer than expected.

This is useful for EC2 instances that you intend to bring up and down on demand, to make sure
you haven't left them running and costing you money!

Note that this tool was developed for my personal use, and though I hope others find it useful,
I accept no responsibility for VM instance fees incurred through the incorrect or unexpected
functioning of the program. Caveat coder!
